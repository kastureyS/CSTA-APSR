1,0,TRUE,,-1,,,This is an overall negative evaluation that states that suggests rejection would be justified.,FALSE,This sort of mixed feedback would normally lead me to reject the manuscript for publication.,"Third, and related to the previous points, there is a question as to how well this technique travels beyond the simple textual example provided. Several of the reviewers point out that perhaps it does not travel well beyond English, and wonder whether the argument about the generalizability of the technique could be strengthened.","However, I believe that this piece has enormous potential, and if properly and thoroughly revised, it COULD represent a fine addition to the APSR. For this reason, we believe that we can extend to you the opportunity to revise and resubmit the paper for further consideration."
2,0,TRUE,,-1,,,This negative comment suggests that the article should be rejected.,FALSE,The manuscript fails to make a sufficient contribution to justify publication.,"While the authors have demonstrated the effectiveness of this method for analyses of parties' policy positions, this paper does not appear to be the introduction of a new method. Rather, this paper outlines, in an admittedly effective manner, the conditions under which the method can be utilized to produce certain types of data.","Moreover, while the paper has convincingly demonstrated that crowd sourcing is an efficient method of calculating parties' policy positions from textual data sources in the British context, the authors have not demonstrated the applicability of this method for other types of data. Would the authors have found as reliable of estimates for languages other than English?"
3,0,TRUE,,-1,,,This negative comment suggests that the article should be rejected.,FALSE,The intellectual contribution of the manuscript is too limited.,"The leads us to the question of publication in APSR. From my perspective, the paper, in a revised version, would be perfect for a specialized journal such as Political Analysis.","After all, Crowd-Sourcing has existed long before this paper even though it does a nice job in presenting it to a political science audience."
4,0,TRUE,,-1,,,"This states that making a decision on publishing the article was difficult, which is negative from the standpoint of deciding whether it should be published.",FALSE,We found making a decision on this manuscript to be very difficult.,"However after a great deal of thought and discussion with my colleagues on the editorial team,  we believe that there is considerable  potential to this paper. Thus we want to give you an opportunity to address the issues raised by the reviewers, and  would like to invite you to revise and resubmit your paper ""Crowd-sourced Coding of Political Texts"" (APSR-D-14-00400) for further consideration.","The reviews, at best are split with reviewers 1 and 2 rather positive about the piece (although much of the their positive assessments are based on the potential important impact of the paper) whereas reviewers 3, 4, and 5 are rather negative. Reviewers 3 and 4 recommend rejection of the paper, and reviewer 5 recommends very major revisions."
5,0,TRUE,,-1,,,"This question casts doubt on what is a key positive claim of the paper, which also casts doubt on whether it should be published.",FALSE,"Is this really the solution to all of our problems, as the paper suggests?","But what if I am involved in the policy agendas project, with its current 19 major topics and 224 subtopics? Or what if my project crosses languages as in the CMP?","It would be helpful for the authors to reflect more on the scope of feasible projects, limitations of the worker bee population etc in their conclusion. But overall the paper is in great shape."
6,0,TRUE,,-1,,,This is a (mildly) negative statement stating that the article's presentation is unclear.,FALSE,But this material is quite difficult to understand.,"In addition to the above, there is one minor point that the authors may wish to clarify. The authors rely very heavily on supplementary materials found in the appendix.","Frequently, in the main text of the document, the authors refer the reader to the supplementary materials in general, rather than any specific area of the 27 page appendix. Moreover, much of the information found in the appendix has no discussion or information about how to situate the analyses."
7,0,TRUE,,-1,,,"This statement casts doubt on the ability of crowdsourcing to create sound data, as crowds are uninformed.",FALSE,"Put another way, an uninformed group will give uninformed answers.","The figure shows clearly that the mean ""wisdom of crowds"" position is statistically indistinguishable from the mean positions of moderately to unsophisticated respondents. Moreover, the highly knowledgeable respondents place the party to the right to both the low, moderately, knowledgeable and total number of respondents, with all such comparisons being statistical significant.","What matters therefore, is not how many people are in the crowd, but to establish a mechanism in which researchers can pick and use only those from the crowd that are actually knowledgeable about the task at hand because these are the ones that give the most useful responses. The responses of all others, do not only add noise in the estimates, but can steer away the estimate from the true value (unreliability limits the chance of validity as Krippendorff 2004a, pp. 212–214 famously illustrated)."
8,0,TRUE,,-1,,,"This statement casts doubt on the value of crowd-sourced data, as other methods could be better and more efficient.",FALSE,It's also possible that other methods would be more efficient and more cost-effective.,"For instance, the authors claim that crowdsourcing is ""inexpensive"" (p. 31) since it cost them $360 to code 9 manifestos for one policy area (so $40, about 28 euros per party per policy area). cf. this to Gemenis and van Ham (2014) who used an Delphi aggregation with 7 experts (ranging from professors to master’s students) which cost them 980 euros to code 8 parties for 6 policy areas (so 20.40 euros per party per policy area).",The results of crowdsourcing immigration policy positions (Table 4) produced wide confidence intervals that made most parties statistically indistinguishable from each other. $360 were spent just to find out that BNP and UKIP can be distinguished from all other British parties (but the other parties could not be distinguished from one another).
9,0,TRUE,,0,,,This is a neutral statement since it contains an even balance of positive and negative references.,FALSE,This is mentioned both by reviewer 1 (who suggests accepting the paper) and reviewer 5 (who suggests we should reject the paper).,"In particular there appear to be three major objections to the paper expressed by the reviewers. First, although you do an admirable job in demonstrating crowd sourcing might be a good alternative to expert coding, it is not clear what is being compared here - what is meant by ""expert coding"" - as Reviewer 1 notes, this can mean different things.","For instance, both reviewers note that whether crowd sourcing is a viable alternative, and whether it really saves time and effort depends  on what the alternatives are (which are not described in much detail in the paper). As reviewer1 notes: ""if this is to work correctly, experts do have to come up with a set of clear, detailed instructions, and they need to come up with numerous ""gold questions"" to evaluate coder quality"" - then how much time and effort is actually saved?"
10,0,TRUE,,0,,,This is a neutral statement of instructions rather than evaluations.,FALSE,In a revised piece you should respond to all of the points made by this group of helpful and perceptive referees.,"This is not a guarantee of publication, only that we believe that there is enough potential here to warrant taking a chance on the paper. Thus, after our own reading of the paper, we agree that major revisions need to be made to the piece before resubmission.",
11,0,TRUE,,0,,,This is a neutral statement not referring specifically in the sentence to negative or positive evaluations.,FALSE,"With this in mind, I would like to bring up two important points.","The authors are extremely careful both in laying out how well the crowd-sourcing of manifestos recover expert codings both in laying out how well the crowd-sourcing of manifestos recover expert codings and in outlining the process by which such crowd-sourcing should be done. I really don't have many serious criticisms of the methods used by authors, and I think that the paper, if published, will be a highly cited ""benchmark"" contribution.","One is that it would be easy to conclude by the end of the paper that crowd-sourcing is very ""cheap"" in that not much valuable expert time is needed to analyze the texts. But if this is to work correctly, experts do have to come up with a set of clear, detailed instructions, and they need to come up with numerous ""gold questions"" to evaluate coder quality."
12,0,TRUE,,0,,,This is a neutral statement outlining the issues rather than making a direct evaluation.,FALSE,The core questions involve how computation and human methods can be combined.,"If a dataset has limitations with respect to a particular research question, those limitations were often overlooked because 'it is the best we have'. The revolution is not just about crowdsourcing but also machine learning and even basic text scraping.","Sadly, these are not methods that are taught in most political science departments at this point. The methods described in this paper are not complicated or inaccessible to the average political scientist."
13,0,TRUE,,0,,,This is a neutral statement summarizing the claim of the paper rather than evaluating the paper.,FALSE,This paper proposes that crowd-sourced coding can be used to generate data in our discipline.,,"The article shows that crowd sourcing can be used to generate data on party positions in the UK from party manifestos. The article further shows that the positions generated based on crowd sourcing correlate very well with both externally generated measures and with the results of coding from ""experts"" following the same procedure as ""the crowd""."
14,0,TRUE,,-1,,,"This mildly negative statement points to deficiencies that need attention, if the paper is to be improved.",FALSE,This needs to be done for both the core argument and to demonstrate better efficiency.,"The meta-analysis of Rowe & Wright (1999) for instance, reviewed dozens of studies that showed the superiority of Delphi aggregation schemes over simple statistical ones. Bottom line is that the authors need to do much more convincing with regards to the superiority of crowdsourcing over other i) classic content analysis with trained coders, and ii) behavioral aggregation schemes such as Delphi.","For instance, the authors claim that crowdsourcing is ""inexpensive"" (p. 31) since it cost them $360 to code 9 manifestos for one policy area (so $40, about 28 euros per party per policy area). cf. this to Gemenis and van Ham (2014) who used an Delphi aggregation with 7 experts (ranging from professors to master’s students) which cost them 980 euros to code 8 parties for 6 policy areas (so 20.40 euros per party per policy area)."
15,0,TRUE,,1,,,This mildly positive statement points to positive qualities found by readers of the paper.,FALSE,"On the plus side, all of the reviewers see great potential to this manuscript and see it as potentially having a huge positive contribution to data generation in political science.","Reviewers 3 and 4 recommend rejection of the paper, and reviewer 5 recommends very major revisions. Despite these differences in judgments, the reviewers are actually remarkably similar in their assessments, both positive and negative, about the paper.","However they all indicate, even the more positive reviewers, that there is great room for improvement, and that much more work needs to be done in order for this piece to be ready for the APSR. In particular there appear to be three major objections to the paper expressed by the reviewers."
16,0,TRUE,,1,,,This mildly positive statement points to positive qualities if a revision can address the concerns raised by the readers of the first version,FALSE,"However, I believe that this piece has enormous potential, and if properly and thoroughly revised it would make a worthy publication.","Several of the reviewers point out that perhaps it does not travel well beyond English, and wonder whether the argument about the generalizability of the technique could be strengthened. Given this array of reviews, I would normally seriously consider rejecting the piece.","For this reason, we believe that we can extend to you the opportunity to revise and resubmit the paper for further consideration. This is not a guarantee of publication, only that we believe that there is enough potential here to warrant taking a chance on the paper."
17,0,TRUE,,1,,,This mildly positive statement points to good qualities of the paper.,FALSE,"This is a very mature, well-executed piece of research.","The paper itself is very well researched and written. The authors are quite transparent about the limits of their project, and they do not cut corners in terms of collecting the evidence needed to support their assertions about the limits of expert coding, awareness of the source, and the efficacy of alternative crowd sourcing approaches.",One discussion that I was looking for that was not in the main paper was details about the total time and cost involved in crowdsourcing this project. Not just paying the workers but also the time involved for the researchers and for contracting with CrowdFlower?
18,0,TRUE,,-1,,,This mildly negative statement casts doubt on the usefulness of the crowd-sourcing approach.,FALSE,"The question remains open, however, as to how useful this will be.",Most of the article is a well-written introduction to the technical details of crowd sourcing. After reading the article I am convinced that crowd sourcing could be potentially useful for data generation in political science.,"As I see it, this will depend on a number of factors which are not really ￼carefully discussed in this version of the paper, partly because the alternative to crowd-sourcing is not very well described. The paper talks a lot about expert coding, however what that means is unclear."
19,0,TRUE,,1,,,This mildly positive statement is optimistic that the shortcomings of the paper can be corrected.,FALSE,But I think that most of these questions can be resolved by the authors in a revised version.,"The paper makes a significant contribution in the field and I could see this being published in generalist journal such as APSR. I have, however, some reservations with regards to the argument that the paper has been built upon, as well as some points regarding the presentation of the results.","Challenging the wisdom of crowds: From the very first pages (pp. 1–2), I think that the authors have misunderstood the content analysis literature (e.g. Krippendorff) with regards to the utility of having multiple coders per document. The point raised in content analysis literature is not to code the same document multiple times in order to aggregate the codings and compute measures of uncertainty."
20,0,TRUE,,1,,,"This is a strong positive statement about the value of the paper, suggesting that it should be published.",FALSE,This is an outstanding paper that could transform the way that researchers code political texts.,,"Existing methods are either expert codings - which tend to be expensive, since experts are in short supply, and (for the same reason) have replicability problems - or computer-automated analyses, which have not yet proven reliable (at least in my opinion) in inferring meaning from words (usually because the context in which the words are used is ignored). The crowd-sourcing method advocated in the current paper represents a viable alternative approach that can produce valid estimates of quantities such as issue saliency estimates and spatial positioning scores quickly and cheaply."
21,0,TRUE,,1,,,"This is a strong positive statement about the value of the paper, suggesting that it should be published.",FALSE,Overall the paper is excellent.,"Is this really the panacea the authors suggest? It would be helpful for the authors to reflect more on the scope of feasible projects, limitations of the worker bee population etc in their conclusion.",
22,0,TRUE,,1,,,"This is a strong positive statement about the value of the paper, suggesting that it should be published.",FALSE,"All in all, this paper  offers a thoroughly convincing demonstration reliability of data produced through crowd sourcing.","In the second set of analyses, the authors demonstrate that the method can be used to gather novel data by using crowd-sourcing to capture British party positions on immigration, and demonstrate its robustness in comparison to two types of expert coding. While the paper is a competent and thorough demonstration of the benefits of the use of crowd-sourced data to capture political party positions, I do not believe that the paper offers a novel enough contribution to warrant publication in the APSR, and I do not recommend that the paper be accepted for publication.","Using an expert group of coders and a crowd-sourced group of coders, the authors demonstrate that crowd sourcing can produce reliable estimates based on textual analyses, given sufficiently precise and simple coding decisions. The authors are able to demonstrate that the data gathered using a crowd source produces nearly identical results to that created by experts using the same method of coding."
23,0,TRUE,,-1,,,"This is a test question, and you should follow the instructions literally.",TRUE,Ignore the context and code this sentence as anti-publication.,3) How complex coding jobs can be done. The coding example in the text is simple.,"Would that work through ""CrowdFlower""? Student coders need intensive training, but maybe crowd sourcing works without it if enough people code the same sentence, but then costs probably increases?"
25,0,TRUE,,0,,,"This is a test question, and you should follow the instructions literally.",TRUE,Ignore the context and code this sentence as neutral.,"These kinds of demonstrations would be very helpful in understanding the validity of the data. In this vein, while the authors are able to generally demonstrate the robustness of their codings, I did have one question on the Labour Parties' social estimates between the crowd codings and the expert codings.","For example, the experts place Labour at 0.45 in 2001, while the crowd places them at -1.44.   The authors do note that the standard errors are greater in the case of social policy, and that the overall trend indicates that they can be used as replacements, but this seems like quite an important distinction, and the authors should probably discuss this in greater detail, since it seems like a potentially major weakness of their coding. In addition to the above, there is one minor point that the authors may wish to clarify."
26,0,TRUE,,1,,,"This is a test question, and you should follow the instructions literally.",TRUE,Ignore the context and code this sentence as pro-publication.,"Expert surveys are popular because it is cheap to send out a questionnaire to a number of political scientists and having them for instance place parties on a left-right scale. However, this is only feasible for some very specific coding talks.",This is what is typically done for data collection where man-power is more important than expert knowledge. This is the type of coding which might be replaced by crowd- sourcing.
