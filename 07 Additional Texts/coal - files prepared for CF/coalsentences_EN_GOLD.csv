1,0,EN,TRUE,-1,"This sentence is anti-subsidy because it condemns the previous extension of state aid to unprofitable mines, and cites harm to competitiveness as a result.",FALSE,"However, the previous laws supporting the unprofitable mines, rather than helping them to become profitable, instead encouraged continued waste and uncompetitiveness.","Firstly, the proposal to grant operating aid or investment in order to make the mines competitive. There was already a similar provision in the previous regulation concerning aid to the sector.","The mines were subsidised in the vain hope of achieving profitability. Now we have to deal with the consequences: we need to extend this special system for coal production because the mines concerned have not achieved profitability, nor have they been closed."
2,0,EN,TRUE,-1,This sentence is a blanket statement criticizing state aid.,FALSE,State aid undermines competitiveness.,That is whe we consider it to be necessary to phase out subsidies. Part 2 of our proposal mentions this point.,"Therefore, the treaty contains provisions for declaring it incompatible in a whole range of cases. Operating aid can only be authorised if it is likely to have positive effects."
3,0,EN,TRUE,-1,This statement criticizes state aid and cites the need to be competitive instead of propping up unprofitable activities.,FALSE,The mining industry needs to be competitive and subsidising it undermines this objective.,"Madam President, Mr Almunia, ladies and gentlemen, no one disputes the fact that coal is an important part of our energy supply.",The question now is whether 2014 or 2018 is the right deadline. Mr Rapkay put forward a number of intelligent arguments which I will not repeat.
4,0,EN,TRUE,-1,"This statement attacks subsidies being economically unsustainable,  as well as environmentally undesirable.",FALSE,We must remember that continuing to keep these unprofitable coal mines alive defeats this purpose.,"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, our party has no objection to public funds being invested, provided that they manage our transition to productivity and profitability.","It props up an industry that is not sustainable either economically - otherwise it would not need subsidies - or environmentally. As Mrs in ’t Veld emphasised just now, for several decades, the coal industry has been calling for this transition to be extended, with no end in sight."
5,0,EN,TRUE,-1,This is a skeptical (negative) statement about continuing subsidies.,FALSE,"In light of this, I have serious doubts about the intention now to extend the state subsidies for unprofitable coal mines.","We must have a goal when it comes to the automotive industry, the engineering industry and the medical industry. In order to be successful we need to transform our economy to enable it to meet the demands of modern competition and the global economy.","It will mean that, at state level, we will be tying up money in undertakings which are not profitable and ultimately unable to support jobs. "
6,0,EN,TRUE,-1,"This statement argues that further extension of state aid is undesirable, and promotes ending them sooner rather than later..",FALSE,"Madam President, Mr Almunia, we need to swallow the bitter pill now, rather than endure decades more of uncompetitive sickness.",,This is why I support the Commission proposal to phase out State aid in 2014 for the pits which are not competitive by that date.
7,0,EN,TRUE,-1,"This statement is part of an argument that unprofitable mines are blocking a move to more competitiveness, and that continuing state aid simply hinders the inevtiable closures of the unprofitable mines.",FALSE,"European coal mines will, sooner or later, have to adapt to change.",Globalisation means that there will be significant price pressures on coal.,Continued state aid to mines that are not profitable only slows this process of adaptation and hinders our ability to make necessary changes.
8,0,EN,TRUE,-1,"This statement argues that further extension of state aid is undesirable, and promotes ending them sooner rather than later..",FALSE,Unprofitable industries must not be kept on a life support machine forever.,"Production will transfer to countries where labour is cheaper and the areas in the EU where coal is produced will see jobs and income drain away, as mines can no longer respond to the competition. Although this is an unwelcome development, the actions of the authorities cannot conflict with the basic principles of the market economy.",We must remember that structural change on this scale will inevitably have far­reaching and dramatic social consequences. 
9,0,EN,TRUE,-1,"This statement condemns artificial support to uncompetitive industries, and argues for an end to state aid sooner rather than later.",FALSE,We would be taking measures directly counter to the spirit of competition and efficiency if the Parliament were to allow the Member States to squander billions on its coal mines.,"Despite all the fine speeches on climate, Europe will still be clinging onto its coal­black past by adopting this report. Under the Europe 2020 strategy, the EU would like to move swiftly towards a low emissions future based on renewable forms of energy.","The current rules on aid would have expired in December, but in the Commission’s proposals, they would be extended until 2014. The coal­black gloom is intensified by the fact that Parliament wants the rules on aid to be extended all the way to 2018. Two years ago, aid from the EU Member States to industry that produced and used hard coal, that is to say, anthracite, was as much as EUR 2.9 billion. That only shows that there is still many times more aid for fossil fuels than there is for renewable energy sources, and this despite the fact that our targets on climate would call for just the opposite policy."
10,0,EN,TRUE,-1,"This statement is anti-subsidy because it supports the Commission proposal to phase them out by 2014, rather than extending them to 2018 or beyond.",FALSE,We should support the Commission’s proposal.,"It will also mean that the transformation we need in order to be able to become truly competitive will be slower. It will mean that we fail to develop within other areas and also that, in a few years time, people will still be employed in industries that do not offer long-term security and the opportunity to make a living, and those regions that we are now talking about will still remain dependent on coal mining in what are unprofitable coal mines.",
11,0,EN,TRUE,-1,"This statement is anti-subsidy because it supports the Commission proposal to phase them out by 2014, rather than extending them to 2018 or beyond.",FALSE,These funds are not being spent on developing sustainable and competitive industries for the future.,I support the Commission proposal to phase out State aid in 2014 for the pits which are not competitive by that date. The cost of supporting uncompetitive jobs is far higher than in almost any other sector.,"Therefore, I believe it is right to phase out state subsidies for uncompetitive mines in 2014, and to invest the money that becomes available in research and development and in education and training. "
12,0,EN,TRUE,-1,"This statement is anti-subsidy because it supports the Commission proposal to phase them out by 2014, rather than extending them to 2018 or beyond.",FALSE,This is why the plan to end subsidies by 2014 proposal is highly sensible.,"For this reason, I endorse what is said in the impact assessment. Otherwise, the result will be to further undermine our competitive environment, something that no one wants.",
13,0,EN,TRUE,-1,"This statement is anti-subsidy because it supports the Commission proposal to phase them out by 2014, rather than extending them to 2018 or beyond.",FALSE,"Our proposal therefore establishes a gradual reduction in aid, with a target to remove it altogether by 2014.","Finally, my last  point is that when the objective of the operating aid is to contribute to a transition towards closing uncompetitive mines, it is clear that this closure must be our eventual goal. This gradual nature must be clearly set out in the closure plan, and the plan must also include a diminishing proportion of that aid during the transition period.","Having said all this, I would once again like to thank Mr Rapkay and everyone who contributed to the report that we are considering."
14,0,EN,TRUE,-1,"This statement is anti-subsidy because it supports the Commission proposal to phase them out by 2014, rather than extending them to 2018 or beyond.",FALSE,"For these reasons, we support the proposal for a gradual phase-out of subsidies by 2014, but not for any longer.",The plan outlined in the Commission proposal is well supported by evidence. This evidence is clearly outlined in the impact statement.,The plan to end these unsustainable arrangements by 2014 is already a compromise. We should embrace this sensible proposal rather than continue to delay the inevitable.
15,0,EN,TRUE,0,"This statement is a neutral reference and not directly taking a position on the subsidies, the Commission report, or a time-frame for phasing out state aid.",FALSE,It was a successor arrangement.,"There is the argument that the State aid scheme adopted in 2002, which is about to expire, was a phasing out arrangement for coal mining. This is not completely accurate.","I know this, because I was there and I was the rapporteur for Parliament in 2002. So were many of my colleagues."
16,0,EN,TRUE,0,"This statement is a neutral reference and not directly taking a position on the subsidies, the Commission report, or a time-frame for phasing out state aid.",FALSE,I would like to discuss three points from the report.,"However, when drawing up the regulation, we also took all available facts into  account. In our proposal for a regulation, we allowed the Member States to grant additional operating aid, but on this occasion, focusing on the issue of time frame.","Firstly, the proposal to grant operating aid or investment in order to make the mines competitive. There was already a similar provision in the previous regulation concerning aid to the sector."
17,0,EN,TRUE,0,"This statement is a neutral reference and not directly taking a position on the subsidies, the Commission report, or a time-frame for phasing out state aid.",FALSE,We need to consider two additional issues.,"The aim of our proposal is to ensure that these deadlines are respected once and for all. This is a time when, unlike the context in which past debates took place, we have to take into consideration aid for coal mining.","The first is the challenge of climate change, which we have debated on numerous occasions and for which the European Union has very specific targets. The second issue is the impact of the crisis and the resulting borrowing on government budgets, budgets at the national level, as this is placing even more pressure on public finances."
18,0,EN,TRUE,0,"This statement is a neutral reference and not directly taking a position on the subsidies, the Commission report, or a time-frame for phasing out state aid.",FALSE,As you know - as Mr Kovacs mentioned earlier - this is a Council regulation.,"There is also a debate in the Council, and we are going to wait for the Council meeting at the beginning of December to see what the Council's position is. There has certainly been a debate in the Commission, and there will be another.","Parliament's opinion is very important, but the treaty states that, on matters of public aid, the regulation is a Council regulation. The Council will establish its position."
19,0,EN,TRUE,0,"This statement is a neutral reference and not directly taking a position on the subsidies, the Commission report, or a time-frame for phasing out state aid.",FALSE,The Council will establish its position.,"The treaty states that, on matters of public aid, the regulation is a Council regulation.","Currently - at the last meeting of the Permanent Representatives Committee – the group expressed a clear position. Unless the Council decides unanimously, however, the Commission proposal cannot be legally modified."
20,0,EN,TRUE,0,"This statement is a neutral reference, pointing to both sides of the debate.",FALSE,We have all considered the arguments both for and against the proposal to continue subsidizing the coal mines.,"The coal mine closures may have a major social impact. At the same time, mine closures will also have a significant impact on the energy sector.","However we decide, our view must strike a careful balance between the need for competitiveness and the need to minimize the potentially adverse socio-economic consequences of closure."
21,0,EN,TRUE,0,"This statement is a neutral reference and not directly taking a position on the subsidies, the Commission report, or a time-frame for phasing out state aid.",FALSE,That is both admirable and remarkable.,"There are good reasons why you and the Commission President, Mr Barroso, took part in the debate. I am pleased that the Commission is able to discuss issues so openly from a regulatory perspective.",We are very grateful for your input.
22,0,EN,TRUE,0,"This statement is a neutral reference and not directly taking a position on the subsidies, the Commission report, or a time-frame for phasing out state aid.",FALSE,I would like to present a different perspective.,"Madam President, we have already listened to the views of my fellow Members who emphasised how important coal is to the European economy’s energy security.","In some countries, there has been a growing concern with the environmental impacts of non-renewable energy production. At the same time there has been growing concern over the dangers of nuclear power."
23,0,EN,TRUE,0,"This statement is a neutral reference and not directly taking a position on the subsidies, the Commission report, or a time-frame for phasing out state aid.",FALSE,"In this respect, I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Rapkay.","Finally, the 21st century economy has been mentioned. I believe indeed that we need to be involved with this economy but, at the same time, we must focus on diversifying current potential.",
24,0,EN,TRUE,0,"This statement is a neutral reference and not directly taking a position on the subsidies, the Commission report, or a time-frame for phasing out state aid.",FALSE,I have just one request  to the Commission.,The question now is whether 2014 or 2018 is the right deadline. We have all heard a number of intelligent arguments which I will not repeat.,The burden now falls to us to make a correct decision. I hope that my colleagues will consider the issues very carefully.
25,0,EN,TRUE,0,"This statement is a neutral reference and not directly taking a position on the subsidies, the Commission report, or a time-frame for phasing out state aid.",FALSE,It concerns a Council regulation.,"I would like to thank the working group for its careful efforts, working in close cooperation with the Christian Democratic Group.The process is still based on Regulation No 17 dating back to 1965. ","There is a loophole in the Treaty of Lisbon which means that regulations on the basis of competition law do not form part of Parliament’s codecision procedure. Therefore, we now need - at least as far as our statement is concerned - a broad majority vote."
26,0,EN,TRUE,0,"This statement is a neutral reference and not directly taking a position on the subsidies, the Commission report, or a time-frame for phasing out state aid.",FALSE,"Madam President, this is not a straightforward matter.",,It is therefore important for us in Parliament to establish a well-balanced position. There are two main aspects to take into consideration.
27,0,EN,TRUE,0,"This statement is a neutral reference and not directly taking a position on the subsidies, the Commission report, or a time-frame for phasing out state aid.",FALSE,The debate has focused on three key issues.,It is extremely important for all of these opportunities to be fully utilised by national and regional authorities. Large-scale investment in active labour market initiatives and comprehensive environmental restoration measures is essential if the end result is to be acceptable for these regions.,"Firstly, the argument has been put forward that the coal mines that become competitive during the closure period should be able to continue to operate. In my opinion, this issue requires very careful consideration."
28,0,EN,TRUE,0,"This statement is a neutral reference and not directly taking a position on the subsidies, the Commission report, or a time-frame for phasing out state aid.",FALSE,So they should vote in order to state their views.,We have requested a separate vote on Amendments 25 and 27.,"Whatever we decide here today, we should send a clear signal to the Commission. We should show that Parliament is capable of considering the past but also of looking to the future."
29,0,EN,TRUE,0,"This statement is a neutral reference and not directly taking a position on the subsidies, the Commission report, or a time-frame for phasing out state aid.",FALSE,The Council will establish its position.,"As mentioned earlier, this is a Council regulation. Parliament’s opinion is very important, but the treaty states that, on matters of public aid, the regulation is a Council regulation.",Currently - at the last meeting of the Permanent Representatives Committee – we  thoroughly debated the clear impact assessment which you see before you today.
30,0,EN,TRUE,1,"This statement argues that state aid should be extended, instead of phased out by 2014 as per the Commission proposal.",FALSE,"For these reasons, the justification for accelerated closure is wrong.","Our climate footprint is much worse for imported coal because this has to be transported here from Canada, Australia or other regions of the world.","Restricting our ability to produce European coal with European mines will ultimately result in more pollution and more carbon release, not less. In this respect, the views expressed in support of phaseout are incorrect."
31,0,EN,TRUE,1,"This statement argues that state aid should be extended, instead of phased out by 2014 as per the Commission proposal.",FALSE,Only at the final stage did the Commission propose the unrealistic deadline of 2014.,"Before we bow to political pressure in favour of abandoning coal in such cases, we should ensure diversification of alternative and secure energy supplies. These are the reasons why we will support the compromises presented by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, where we have proposed that the regulation give the possibility to national budgets - which are not EU budgets, after all - to maintain mines in countries in which this is necessary.","We reject this change and would support the continuation of state aid far beyond this deadline, indeed until 2030 if required."
32,0,EN,TRUE,1,"This statement argues that state aid should be extended, instead of phased out by 2014 as per the Commission proposal.",FALSE,"We must continue providing support not only until 2014, but also beyond that time.","Madam President, it is not only justifiable for us to continue supporting the coal industry, but, in my opinion, it is also absolutely essential.",It is our duty to protect the citizens of the European Union from the many negative impacts of globalisation. This also includes offering workers in industries which are not fully competitive on the world market long-term retraining to allow them to take on other jobs.
33,0,EN,TRUE,1,This statement is pro-subsidy because it cites the negative economic consequences for the regions affected by the mine closures.,FALSE,"The drastic reduction in the subsidies for coal mining over recent years has had terrible, negative consequences for many mining regions.","We must enable mining regions to become gradually less dependent on the mining industry without their prosperity being significantly reduced. They must be given a realistic, and gradual, opportunity to restructure their economies.",Many areas were caught suddenly by rapid policy changes. The result has been increased joblessness and regional poverty.
34,0,EN,TRUE,1,"This statement argues that state aid should be extended, instead of phased out by 2014 as per the Commission proposal.",FALSE,The accelerated date of 2014 is an unrealistic deadline for closing the mines.,"In addition, mine workers and their families may lose their confidence in the political process where such decisions are made which affect them directly, if they are made at an inappropriate time. We need to focus our attention just as much on sparsely populated regions, which will suffer the most in socio-economic terms.","On the other hand, the deadline of 2020 specifically proposed by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy should be reconsidered. This is why the extended date of 2018 represents a good compromise."
35,0,EN,TRUE,1,This is a pro-subsidy statement because it argues that the unprofitable mines should be supported because domestic coal production is necessary for safe and secure energy.,FALSE,"Subsidies are not a general route to competitiveness, but making European coal competitive through subsidies is strategically necessary, first of all, because 60% of European energy is imported, and out of the remaining 40%, a large proportion is nuclear - which the majority of this House does not support - and secondly, because of price increases: the European coal price is moving closer and closer to the international coal price.","Madam President, Commissioner, it is a shame that Parliament has a right to nothing more than consultation when what we are talking about is the future of 180 000 European families and the European Union's indigenous energy source par excellence.","Moreover, I would like to ask you: what is competitive coal? Ask yourselves whether all the coal that the European Union imports includes the social and safety costs of the mines that are included in the cost of European coal."
36,0,EN,TRUE,1,This statement supports continued subsidies because of the jobs that depend on the unprofitable mines.,FALSE,State aid for the European coal industry is an absolute necessity.,"It is crucial for the European Union to supply the largest proportion possible of its coal requirements from domestic production. Unless State aid is granted, production will fall by 25%, resulting in hundreds of thousands of lost jobs.",Many mines are only uncompetitive due to their obsolete technical equipment. State aid would allow these facilities to be retrofitted to ensure job security.
37,0,EN,TRUE,1,This is a pro-subsidy statement because it argues that the unprofitable mines should be supported because domestic coal production is necessary for safe and secure energy.,FALSE,European coal is safe coal. ,"Our energy dependence means that only coal can guarantee us a secure supply as an indigenous source of fossil fuel. We must also the unsafe working conditions at many mines found outside of Europe, where workers' lives and safety are put at risk.","Moreover, European coal is clean. Therefore, in the amendments to the Rapkay report, we ask for an indefinite extension to the aid for costs related to carbon emissions capture."
38,0,EN,TRUE,1,This supports state aid to the mines because they could be made to be profitable once more.,FALSE,"Our goal should be to support these mines, with a view to bringing them back to profitability.","Madam President, I would like to say three things. First, the mines not making profits concern only 5% of the mines in the European Union. ","Second, we should also prevent imports of subsidised coal from abroad. Thirdly, we should prevent any interference from lobbyists."
39,0,EN,TRUE,1,This statement supports continued subsidies because of the jobs that depend on the unprofitable mines.,FALSE,Closing the mines before fully using the state aid to minimize the costs of transition will result in extremely severe social problems.,"We should extend the deadline even longer for the closure of uncompetitive mines, as the majority of the population in mining areas are employed from mining. It is absolutely imperative to have plans for professional retraining and socio-economic recovery.","During the current crisis in particular, it would be appropriate also to apply to the European Structural Funds, given the social, economic and environmental importance to the European Union."
40,0,EN,TRUE,1,"This statement supports continued subsidies because European mines guarantee worker safety, where as non-European coal mines do not.",FALSE,What good is competitiveness when it is bought at the expense of miners' lives?,"Do not forget how many mining accidents we hear about in the media. Coal mining is going on all over the world, but unfortunately the safety standards elsewhere are very low when compared to those in Europe.","The consequences of an early end to subisidies will be worker safety and worker lives. For the workers affected, this  is too great a cost to pay for an economic principle."
41,0,EN,TRUE,1,"The 'this chance' in the statement refers to state aid being extended, instead of phased out by 2014 as per the Commission proposal.",FALSE,"I can only say Yes, we must give aid this chance.","Let us not pretend we an avoid this important issue. The question is whether or not we need should give state aid a chance to make a difference, without causing disruption from moving too quickly.",This four-year period is not long enough. Please take that message back to the Commission.
42,0,EN,TRUE,1,"This statement argues that state aid should be extended, instead of phased out by 2014 as per the Commission proposal.",FALSE,"Madame President, Mr Rapkay, there are several compelling arguments against such a rapid end to subsidies.",,I refer primarily to social and economic consequences on a regional scale. It is important that we spend subsidies to facilitate mine closures properly: to ensure that the employees concerned are retrained and redeployed in other sectors of the labour market.
43,0,EN,TRUE,1,This statement supports continued subsidies because of the jobs that depend on the unprofitable mines.,FALSE,"To the areas affect, mine closures mean and end to their main source of livelihood.",We are not arguing that unprofitable production should be continued forever. But we must remember that structural change on this scale will inevitably have far-reaching and dramatic social consequences.,This is reflected in the ability of cities and towns to provide their residents with services and the decline of entire communities. It is in everyone's interest if major social changes such as those associated with the gradual closure of mines take place with the right controls in place and over a sufficient period of transition.
44,0,EN,TRUE,1,This statement supports continued subsidies because of the jobs that depend on the unprofitable mines.,FALSE,"The final and most important reason is the more than 180,000 families that could be affected.","We must not forget that, on many occasions, the mines from which we import coal do not comply with social rights. With regard to regional sustainability, in many cases, the mines are in sparsely populated areas that are entirely dependent on the industry to maintain the region, and we risk turning our lands into deserts.","In my region, people have built their lives around the coal industry. Rapid closure will devastate these communities."
45,0,EN,TRUE,-1,This is the answer consistent with the explicit instructions in this test sentence.,TRUE,Ignore the context and code this sentence as an anti-subsidy statement.,There is absolutely no mention of this in the impact assessment. The only thing which might explain it is that 2014 is exactly halfway between 2010 and 2018. That is what it must be.,"None of the arguments in favour of this proposal can be seriously considered because they are not correct. There is the argument that the State aid scheme adopted in 2002, which is about to expire, was a phasing out arrangement for coal mining."
46,0,EN,TRUE,-1,This is the answer consistent with the explicit instructions in this test sentence.,TRUE,Ignore the context and code this sentence as an anti-subsidy statement.,"The only argument which has been mentioned and which, incidentally, conflicts with the Commission's impact statement that initially seemed to be in favour of 2018, was that environmental policy reasons could play a role here. I would like to emphasise once again that it makes no difference to the climate whether we burn imported or domestic coal.",This is how I understood the reference just now to the Commission considering the issue and I am grateful for this.
47,0,EN,TRUE,1,This is the answer consistent with the explicit instructions in this test sentence.,TRUE,Ignore the context and code this sentence as favoring the continuation of subsidies.,"We must remember that the world coal market is changing before our eyes. Demand for coal, and the price of coal, are rising.","The departure from coal also presents very serious problems for energy security in such countries as Poland, which generate as much as 95% of their electricity from coal. The departure from coal in such situations can involve only one alternative - a still greater dependence on gas, which is imported from only one direction."
48,0,EN,TRUE,1,This is the answer consistent with the explicit instructions in this test sentence.,TRUE,Ignore the context and code this sentence as favoring the continuation of subsidies.,"Do you reject this same idea for European coal? The longer this period is, the better, so that we can introduce the clean combustion and storage technologies that already exist in the European Union.","I do not believe that rejecting the possibility of EU coal, as you are doing, is liberalism: I believe it is hypocrisy."
49,0,EN,TRUE,0,This is the answer consistent with the explicit instructions in this test sentence.,TRUE,Ignore the context and code this sentence as a neutral statement on subsidies. ,The European Commission is trying - at any price and in a way which is not justified by economic rationale - to reduce coal extraction.,I refer to the costs of emissions. It is a policy which undermines the economic foundations of those countries in which most energy is derived from coal.
50,0,EN,TRUE,0,This is the answer consistent with the explicit instructions in this test sentence.,TRUE,Ignore the context and code this sentence as a neutral statement on subsidies. ,"I believe that our approach in this new strategy must not be to increase our dependency on a single hydrocarbon source, but to increase our economic independence. Finally, the 21st century economy has been mentioned.","In this respect, I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Rapkay."
