"4","Labour Party Manifesto 1992. It's time to get Britain working again. Winter ending. 'A cold coming we had of it' huddled together in cardboard cities, crouched over shared books in leaking classrooms, crammed into peeling waiting-rooms, ice stamped into crazy-paving round polluted streams."

"13","Gripped by the longest recession since the war, Britain needs a government with a clear sense of direction and purpose."
"14","A government with the people and the policies to get Britain working again and to achieve sustained recovery -strength with staying power.ÃŠ Labour will be such a government."

"16","It is also a choice between values."
"17","At the core of our convictions is belief in individual liberty."
"18","We therefore believe: First, that for liberty to have real meaning the standards of community provision must be high and access to that provision must be wide."
"19","Second, that those rights of the individual must, like all others in a free society, belong to all men and women of every age, class and ethnic origin and be balanced by responsibilities of fair contribution and law-abiding conduct."
"20","Third, that for rights and responsibilities to be exercised fully and fairly, government in Britain as in other industrialised democracies, must work to build prosperity by properly supporting research, innovation, the improvement of skills, the infrastructure and long-term industrial development."
"21","Our vision for Britain is founded on these values."
"22","Guided by them, we will make our country more competitive, creative, and just more secure against crime, aggression and environmental danger."
"23","We want government to serve the whole nation - using its power to realise this vision."
"24","Labour will be such a government."
"25","These are our convictions and we will work to fulfil them."
"26","They are also down-to-earth aims - essential objectives in a country hit by recession, suffering run-down public services and facing the intensifying pressures of European and global economic competition."
"27","Ml of those realities require that the government provides: a stable economic environment education and training that fosters the abilities of all young people and adults a firm emphasis on productive investment in both the public and private sectors. "
"28","Labour will implement and maintain those policies."
"29","They are vital for prosperity, for consistently low inflation and for continuous improvement in economic performance and living standards."
"30","They are also fundamental to improving the quality and quantity of provision in health and social services, and to combating poverty."
"31","We have absolute commitment to a high-quality National Health Service, free at time of need and not fractured and weakened by underfunding and a commercialised contract system."
"32","We will get on with fulfilling that commitment from the moment of our election - by strengthening and modernising the NHS, by extending care in the community and by establishing the National Health Initiative to prevent illness."
"33","Our pledges to increase the income of pensioners and families with children will urgently be fulfilled."
"34","Our undertakings to stop the perpetual experiments in schools and to raise standards of investment and achievement in education will be kept in full."

"37","In that future, we are determined that Britain will be a leader in the New Europe, setting higher standards and not surrendering influence by opting out."
"38","We have confidence in our country and in the qualities and potential of its people."
"39","We want to nourish their artistic, scientific, sporting and other abilities."
"40","And we want to enhance their democratic power too."

"44","Neither their legal status nor their chances in education, training and employment are full or free."
"45","We will ensure that the barriers to fairness are removed."
"46","These policies, like many others, manifest our practical commitment to freedom."
"47","That purpose is not confined to the shores of our country."
"48","In an age where liberty has made great advances in the world, there is still conflict, instability and want, causing great misery and inhibiting the peace and co-operation which we want to help to build."
"49","We shall, therefore ensure that our country has the defence capacity, the strength of alliance and the peace-making commitment necessary to safeguard the United Kingdom, to participate in international negotiations for disarmament, to deter aggression and to contribute to constructing a New World Order, now feasible through the strengthened United Nations."

"261","We will consult widely to ensure smooth implementation."
"263","We will promote a stake for employees. Employees should have the opportunity to own collectively a significant stake in the company for which they work, through a democratic Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP) or a co-operative."

"650","We support the commitment in the Anglo-Irish Agreement that 'any change in the status of Northern reland would only come about with the consent of a majority in Northern Ireland'."
"651","We will work within the agreement to achieve our policy of unity by consent, and strengthen measures against injustice, discrimination and deprivation."
"652","We will fight terrorism by every lawful means, repealing the counter-productive Prevention of Terrorism Act and replacing it with measure which is more effective and genuinely acceptable in a democratic society."

"660","This general election was called only after months of on-again, off-again dithering which damaged our economy and weakened our democracy."
"661","No government with a majority should be allowed to put the interests of party above country as the Conservatives have done."
"662","Although an early election will sometimes be necessary, we will introduce as a general rule a fixed parliamentary term."

"716","Labour will establish a separate Department of State for International development, whose Minister will be in the Cabinet."
"717","Tackling poverty will be the top priority of our aid programme."
