"182","We are committed to a free market, to free trade and to the creation of a competitive and enterprising economy."
"183","We do not believe it is government's job to run business - people do that much better."

"188","Turning Britain Round. The current recession is undermining Britain's competitiveness and future success."
"189","Unemployment and business closures lead to a wastage of talent and a loss of resources."
"190","At the same time, essential investment in our country's future, in infrastructure, in education and training and in innovation, is being neglected."
"191","Liberal Democrats will introduct an emergency programme of investment to end the slump."
"192","We will immediately put in hand a major programme of public capital investment, funded by reversing the Tory tax cut together with a prudent increase in borrowing."

"260","Serving Customers. Many financial institutions, and particularly some of the high-street banks, have a poor record of customer service, for individuals and businesses."
"261","It is far too common to see charges applied to accounts, or interest rates changed, without customers being fully informed, and to see new types of accounts opened without existing customers being told that they could benefit from them."
"262","Banks which are responsive to their customers will be good for the economy."
"263","We will ensure that commercial borrowers are entitled to a full contract specifying the terms, conditions and duration of the services provided."

"293","Changing the Economy for Good. Liberal Democrats recognise that if we are to improve Britain's disappointing economic performance we have to change the governmental system which produces it."
"294","Our proposals for electoral and constitutional reform are a prerequisite for better economic performance."
"295","Proportional representation will produce greater stability in government, ending the economic disruption caused by sudden sharp swings in government policies before and after elections."
"296","Home rule and decentralisation will ensure that economic power and prosperity is spread through Britain."
"297","Integration within Europe will create the framework for long-term economic strength."

"301"," 2.Britain's Environment: Environmental Protection and Conservation. Liberal Democrats are determined to ensure that Britain changes its way so that it becomes a leader, not a laggard, in facing the environmental challenge."
"302","Polluters will pay and conservers will be rewarded."
"303","Taxation will be gradually shifted from the things we want more of - income, savings and value added - to the things we want less of: pollution and resource depletion."
"304","The accelerating destruction of the environment is one of the most serious challenges we face today."
"305","Its symptoms are becoming clearer every year, from global warming to holes in the ozone layer to poisoned rivers and polluted air at home."
"306","They threaten not just our ability to enjoy our towns and countryside but our health and our children's future."
"307","Liberal Democrats aim to cut pollution and clean up the local environment."
"308","We aim to build a society that does not create wealth at the expense of the environment."

"316","These will be drawn up in conjunction with local planning authorities with the aim of managing the countryside to develop sustainable agriculture, safeguard plant and animal wildlife, and preserve traditional landscape features, such as woods, hedgerows and dry-stone walls."
"317","Reform land use planning so that the protection of the natural environment becomes a major feature of the planning system."

"338","We will increase the number of monitoring stations, ensuring that all major urban areas are covered."
"339","We will publish a regular air pollution index and encourage newspapers and TV and radio weather forecasts to use it."
"340","This will increase public consciousness of the pollution issue and prove of real benefit to the health of vulnerable people."

"343","Direct controls will still be needed in some cases."
"344","We will: Set targets for cutting pollution."
"345","These include a 30% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from the UK by the year 2005"
"346"," our energy policy is greated to this target."
"347","We will ban the use of CFCs and halons by 1994."
"348","Introduce a system of tradable emission licenses."
"349","We will issue factories and power stations with licences setting a ceiling on permitted emissions of pollutants such as sulphur dioxide."
"350","These will be tradable: those who are most efficient at reducing pollution would have surplus licences which they could then sell either to those less efficient, or back to government."
"351","The targets for emissions - and therefore number of licences available - will be reduced year by year, leading to a steady fall in pollution."
"352","Create a new Department of Natural Resources will sole responsibility for environmental protection, leaving the Department of the Environment to cover local government and housing."

"372","We will continue nuclear research, but at a lower cost."
"373","Reprocessing spent nuclear fuel rods increases the volume of waste and should be undertaken only when necessary for safety reasons."

"376","For many households (in, for example, Wales), water bills are now higher than bills for all local government services put together."
"377","Since 1989 nearly a million summonses have been issued to people who could not pay their water bills."

"379","Liberal Democrats will alter the licensing conditions for water companies to extend this to groups of domestic consumers who live on large estates and in sheltered housing complexes."
"380","This District Discount will keep down bills for elderly people and many low-income inner-city residents living on large estates."
"382","Making Transport Clean and Efficient. By expanding the provision and quality of public transport and reducing society's dependence on the private car, we will improve travel efficiency and protect the environment."

"409","We will encourage the use of information technology to decentralise work."
"411","Building a Sustainable Economy. Liberal Democrats aim to build an economy which is not only competitive and enterprising but also environmentally sustainable, leaving future generations a wealth inheritance - of knowledge, technology, capital and environmental assets - at least as great as that inherited by the current generation."
"412","Our proposals are: A better method of measuring economic progress."
"413","The conventional target of growth in GDP is apoor indicator of progress."
"414","We will modify GDP by incorporating measurements of pollution and resource depletion to create a figure for sustainable national income."

"589","This will replace mortgage tax relief for future home buyers, which often helps most those who need it least, and cause enormous distortions in the savings and housing markets."
"590","People holding mortgages will be protected: they will have the choice of moving to housing cost relief or continuing to receive mortgage interest tax relief."
"591","Boost house building and renovation."
"592","We will relax controls on local authority capital receipts, especially for new council building, for houses built in cooperation with housing associations, and for renovation and repair work."

"601","We will legislate to bring into use dwellings left empty without reasonable cause for more than a year."
"602","Adopt new environmental standards for all buildings, commercial and domestic."
"603","We will introduce a requirement for energy audits on all new buildings as a pre-condition of grants for home insulation, solar heating and other energy-saving measures."
"604","Homes which meet the new standards will be exempt from stamp duty on house purchase."
"605","We will encourage shared combined heat and power schemes, and encourage those planning new houses to take into account the scope for passive solar heating."
"607","Home Energy Efficiency Discount. Saving energy in the home makes good environmental sense, and will save money on electricity and gas bills."
"608","We will make houses which meet high standards of energy efficiency exempt from the first GBP 1000 of stamp duty when they are sold."
"609","Their energy standard will be assessed by an energy audit carried out by the local authority's energy efficiency unit."
"610","If a home does not meet the minimum standard, the owner will be able to claim back all money spent within the first year after purchase on raising it to that level, though, for example, home insulation, up to the amount of stampt duty they paid when they bought the property (up to a maximum of GBP 1000)."
"611","This will help to cut pollution and save energy and give a valuable boost to the housing market."
"613","Protecting the Community. Over the past ten years recorded crime has risen faster than at any time in our history."
"614","Meanwhile, prison conditions have deteriorated and the public has lost confidence in the criminal justice system."
"615","Liberal Democrats will reverse this trend by: Creating safe and secure communities."
"616","We will give local authorities the powers to develop comprehensive community crime prevention programmes, improve services to victims and encourage Neighbourhood Watch and Safer City Programmes."

"633","We will introduce improved welfare and legal rights for genuine asylum seekers and establish substantive rights of appeal."
"635","Ensuring a Decent Income for All. The tax and social security systems are long overdue for reform."
"636","Our objectives are to simplify and integrate the two systems, to mount a determined assault on poverty and dependence, and to protect our citizens from want."
"637","We will work towards the eventual creation of a new 'Citizen's Income', payable to all irrespective of sex or status."
"638","For pensioners, the Citizen's Income will be well above the present pension, and for everyone else it will be about GBP 12.80 a week (at present prices)."
"639","Unpaid work will at last be recognised as valuable."
"640","Women caring in the home, for example, will receive an independent income from the state for the first time."
"641","The Citizen's Income will be buttressed by a single benefit for those in need, unifying income support and family credit, with supplements for people with disabilities and for child-care support."
"642","These reforms will ensure that every citizen is guaranteed a decent minimum income, whether or not they are in employment."
"643","Our immediate priorities, which will act as steps towards the Citizen's Income, include: Immediate improvements in benefits."
"644","We will increase Child Benefit by GBP 1 per week for each child."
"645","Income support for under-25s will be paid at the full rate, an increase of GBP 8.50 per week."

"649","Increasing the basic state pension immediately by GBP 5 a week for single pensioners, and by GBP 8 a week for married couples."
"650","This higher basic pension will be paid to every pensioner, regardless of their contributory record, to end the indignity of means testing."
"651","After the initial increase, we will uprate the basic pension every year in line with average earnings."
"652","This will be paid by abolishing SERPS, which does not help the poorest pensioners."
"653","People who have already built up SERPS entitlements will of course still receive their SERPS pension."
"654","Protecting the rights of members of occupational pension schemes."
"655","We will provide a statutory framework of protection, including employee representation on occupational pension trusts."

"657","We will increase Invalidity Benefit by 15%, extend mobility allowance and base payments on medical records rather than National Insurance contributions."
"658","In the longer term we aim to reimburse individuals in full for the additional costs of their disability."
"659","Creating a Carer's Benefit for the many individuals who forgo normal earnings to look after elderly or disabled relatives."
"660","We will convert Invalid Care Allowance into a Carer's Benefit, increasing its value by an immediate 15%, indexing its future level to earnings and altering the entitlement rules to enable that people will still be eliglble even if the caring starts after the carer reaches pensionable age."
"661","Further improvements in benefits."
"662","We will, over the lifetime of a Parliament, phase out the differential in child benefit between the first child and subsequent children"
"663"," reintroduce death and maternity grants"
"664"," increase the family premium for income support and family credit, and reform the system of cold-weather payments."

"670","On earnings above GBP 50,000 a combined rate of 50% will be paid."

"674","A Citizen's Pension. At present many people do not receive the full basic state pension."
"675","If they have not paid enough tax because they have not earned enough during their working lives, people have to rely on means-tested benefits when they retire."
"676","Women in particular are badly affected, because they tend to have the lowest paid jobs and to spend several years looking after children."
"677","Liberal Democrats believe that a pension should be a right for everyone."
"678","We will ensure that the basic state pension is paid as of right and end means testing for our poorest senior citizens."
"679","We will introduce Housing Cost Relief, weighted towards those in need and available to house buyers and renters."
"680","People holding mortgages will have the choice of moving to housing cost relief or continuing to receive mortgage interest tax relief."
"682","Widening Horizons: Investing in the Arts. The arts benefit in two ways."
"683","First, access to the arts is intrinsic to a high quality of life."
"684","Second, the cultural sector - the arts, crafts, design, and audiovisual industries - make as great a net contribution to the economy as does the oil industry."

"709","We will raise revenue for investment in safety by increasing levies on football pools and betting."
"710","We will require local authorities to include sports spectators on ground safety committees."
"712","Guaranteeing Equal Opportunities. A forward-looking society places an equal value on the contribution of all its citizens - and benefits from the participation of all."
"713","Yet in today's Britain many groups of individuals are systematically discriminated against by a society which fails to recognise their right to equality of opportunity."
"714","Liberal Democrats will: Fight discrimination by incorporating the European Convention on Human Rights into UK law and then extending it into a full UK Bill of Rights."
"715","This will reinforce existing protection in British courts against discrimination on the grounds of sex, race, age, disability, religion or secual orientation."

"725","Make old age a time of opportunity."

"742","We believe that by sharing sovereignty and pooling power, Britain and its partners will be better able to achieve commoon goals for the economy, the environment, society and secuiryt than by acting alone."
"743","Our aim is to create a citizens' Europe in which power lies as close to the citizen as possible."
"745","Making Britain's European Presidency Work. Very few of the proposals that we have set out in the preceding sections will be successful unless Britain is prepared to work in partnership within the Community."
"746","Following Maastricht, yet again Britain risks being left behind while the rest of Europe moves on."
"747","Liberal Democrats want Britain to play a full role in creating a dynamic and democratic Europe."
"748","We will use Britain's six-month tenure of the Presidency of the Community's Council of Ministers to make a start on the real tasks that lie ahead: building a prosperous and integrated economy"
"749"," correcting the democratic deficit, making Europe work for its citizens, not its institutions"
"750"," widening the Community's membership"
"751"," and helping to create a peaceful and stable new world order."
"752","We cannot expect Britain to influence the direction the Community takes in the next decade unless it is a full and enthusiastic member."
"753","Our vision of the new Europe is of a federal community, where power is exercised at the lowest level consistent with good government."
"754","For us, federalism means decentralisation: passing powers down more than passing them up."
"755","The creation of Scottish, Welsh and English regional Parliaments therefore goes hand in hand with the promotion of more European cooperation and partnership, ensuring access to power for individuals and their communities right across Europe."
"757","Building a Citizen's Europe. January 1993 will bring the single market."
"758","Economic and monetary union will follow by the end of the decade."
"759","Yet the Community is still too much an organisation for businessmen and bureaucrats instead of citizens and communities."
"760","We want to mould Europe's future in the interests of Europe's people."
"761","Our priorities are: Economic and monetary union including the establishment of an independent European Central Bank and a single European currency."
"762","We will renounce the Conservatives' 'opt-out' clause and accept the timetalbe for EMU."

"764","We will encourage further collaboration within the EC on major scientific projects and the development of new technologies such as telecommunications, information technology and environmentally sustainable innovations."

"767","The proposed European Environmental Agency must be established, a European energy policy drawn up and environmental subsidies and penalties applied Community-wide."
"768","An active regional and social policy."
"769","The single market and economic and monetary union will expose regions and firms to greater competition."
"770","This will be beneficial in the long run, but the EC must assist in the transitional period."
"771","We will renounce Britain's social chapter 'opt-out' and argue for a more flexible framework of social policy across the Community."
"772","The EC should set down minimum standards of health and safety and employee rights, leaving national governments and enterprises to decide how to meet them, subject ultimately to the judgement of the courts."
"773","Fundamental reform of the Common Agricultural Policy."
"774","We will ease the transition from the present wasteful and inefficient price support mechanism to market prices and direct support for farmers' incomes to achieve environmental and social goals, to be funded by savings made from the present intervention payment system."
"776","Creating a New Democracy in Europe. The Communitiy's structure gives far too much weight to the Council of Ministers at the expense of the European Parliament, and, most importantly, of the individual citizen."
"777","Further moves to European union, and enlargement, must depend on the institutions of the EC becoming truly democratic."
"778","We will: Set out the rights of the European citizen."

"782","We will ensure that the Parliament becomes an effective partner with the Council in law-making, exercising in full the power of 'co-decision'."
"783","Introduce fair votes for the 1994 British elections to the European Parliament."
"784","The British citizen must no longer be denied the fair voting systems enjoyed by the citizens of every other European country."
"785","Make the Commission more accountable."
"786","The Parliament must have the power to confirm or deny the Council's nominee as President of the Commission, and then to approve or not the President's choice of Commissioners - and subsequently to sack them if necessary."
"787","We welcome the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty as a first step."
"788","Increase democracy and accountability in the Council of Ministers."
"789","We will argue to extend majority voting in the Council to cover all areas of Community policy other than constitutional and crucial security matters."
"790","When passing laws, the Council should meet in public."
"791","Improve national scrutiny of Ministers' actions in Europe."
"792","We will create a new Europe Committee of the House of Commons, and give our reformed House of Lords a special role in scrutinising developments in the Community."
"793","Prepare for Community enlargement, welcoming EFTA members and, when they are ready, the new deomcracies of Central and Eastern Europe."
"794","A Community with more members requires reformed and dynamic institutions."

"797","Sharing Security.  Working for Peace."
"798","The Gulf War and its aftermath have shown the crucial need for stronger and more effective world institutions capable of upholding international law and enforcing respect for human rights."
"799","Britain must ensure that the Community plays a pivotal role in the construction of a new security order in Europe, following the democratisation of Eastern and Central Europe."
"800","New initiatives for disarmament and for sharing security burdens will enable further reductions in levels of armaments to be made without endangering security."
"801","On the global stage, a stronger United Nations will be needed to underpin cooperation in tackling the world's problems."
"802","We will: Develop common European Community foreign and security policies."
"803","This will include a common approach to defence procurement and the gradual integration of Community members' armed forces under a joint military command."
"804","The burden of collective security in Western Europe should be shared more equally"
"805"," we will press for contributions from all nations to the costs of joint forces such as NATO's proposed Rapid Reaction Force - of which Britain will provide almost half."
"806","Promote democracy and reform in Eastern and Central Europe by coordinating generious economic assistance to countries introducing democracy, guaranteeing human rights and reforming their economies."
"807","Assist the peaceful evolution of the Commonwealth of Independent States, the former USSR."
"808","We will help not just with food and financial aid and technical assistance, but also with the provisino of military resources to shift food and supplies, and with scientific assistance to dismantle nuclear weapons."
"809","Develop a pan-European security framework."
"810","We will encourage the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe to develop monitoring, verification and mediation duties within the continent."
"811","We will press for NATO to guarantee the borders of Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary and to enter into talks with other governments in the region for similar guarantees."
"812","Instigate a comprehensive review of UK defence policy which will be dictated by a rigorous analysis of defence needs rather than by fixed monetary targets."
"813","The Review will cover the continuing need for contributions to collective security, the value of Britain's remaining extra-European commitments, and the potential for increasing our contribution to UN peacekeeping missions."
"814","Given the present hopeful international situation, we believe that further reductions in levels of armaments will be able to be made without in any way endangering security."
"815","Since the review will set out the framework for defence policy for years to come, we will halt any defence cut, and any order for a new weapons system, which might prejudice its outcome."
"816","Establish an Arms Conversion Agency to help arms manufacturers to diversify and convert out of the defence field, funded by savings made in the defence budget."
"817","Out proposed regional developments agencies will also provide help to areas particularly affected."
"818","We will reduce spending on military research and development, and shift the resources into the civilian sector."
"819","Maintain a minimum nuclear deterrent."
"820","We believe that the UK needs to retain its independent nuclear deterrent, but that the escalation of firepower represented by the scale of the Trident replacement for Polaris is unnecessary and unhelpful."
"821","We will ensure that the total number of warheads on the four-boat Trident system is limited to no more than that currently deployed on the Polaris system, and our Defence Review will also examine the possibilities of future European cooperatino in the provision of a deterrent force."
"822","We reject the Government's proposed replacement of British free-fall nuclear bombs with air-to-surface missiles."
"823","Proposed new disarmament initiatives covering all categories of conventional and nuclear weapons."
"824","These will aim to eliminate non-strategic nuclear weapons from Europe, and to reduce the strategic weapons possessed by the US, the former Soviet Union, Britain, France and China - a vital step towards the day when individual nations' possession of nuclear deterrents ceases to be necessary."
"825","Act against the arms trade."
"826","Together with our Community partners, we will establish a register of all international arms sales, eventually to become a UN register."
"827","We will place a total embargo on arms sales to regimes which violate human rights, and work for further global agreements among suppliers to control arms sales and technology transfer."

"831","We will work with our Community partners to ensure that funds are available for maintaining peace and security."
"832","The UN Military Staff Committee should be reinstated and a permanent peacekeeping force established, with member states contributing contingents on an annual basis."
"833","Because of the need to assign British forces to this and to European policing and disaster roles (on top of their present commitments), more general purpose infantry battalions will be required than the number currently planned by the Conservative Government."
"835","Developing Global Prosperity. A secure, democratic and peaceful world can never be created while so much of the globe remains so desperately poor."
"836","Britain must play its part in developing prosperity, protecting the world environment, eradicating poverty, famine and disease, and promoting human rights and international cooperation."
"837","This will include: Increasing overseas aid to reach the UN target of 0.7% of GNP over five years."
"838","We will increase aid especially to democratic countries carrying out policies which benefit the poorest, are environmentally sustainable and respect human rights."

"840","We will promote closer European cooperation, to make the best use of national and Community aid, and avoid wasteful duplication."
"841","We will rejoin UNESCO."
"842","Ending the commercialisation of aid which the current Government has practised and which substantially reduces its value to the world's poorest."
"843","We will reduce the proportion of UK aid tied to the purchase of UK goods and services and ensure that help to British exports is solely a function of the Department of Trade and Industry, rather than the ODA."
"844","Encouraging environmentally sustainable development."
"845","This includes the transfer of appropriate technology, the development of sustainable agriculture and forestry, sustainable use policies for the tropical rain forests and and projects to prevent desertification, and the promotion of energy conservation and renewable energy schemes."
"846","We will provide technical help to develop methods of resource accounting and environmental and ensure that measures of sustainability are incorporated in decisions on development projects and programmes."
"847","Urgent action to tackle the growth in the world's population."
"848","Having doubled in the past fifty years to five billion, the world's population is expected to increase by a further one billion in the 1990s alone."
"849","We will give priority to support for family-planning programmes, education and employment opportunities for women, and basic provisino for old age."
"850","Reform of the world trading and financial systems."
"851","We see the successful conclusion of the Uruguay round of the GATT world trade talks as an urgent priority."
"852","Global prosperity also requires the reversal of the net flow of resources from the global South."
"853","We will press the EC to coordinate international action to resolve the debt crisis, including reducing government-to-government debt, introducint regulatory and tax regimes to encourage commercial banks to reduce or write off debt, extending eligibility to IMF and World Bank loans, and encouraging, where appropriate, debt for development and debt for environment swaps."
"854","We will press for the progressive reduction of all tariff and non-tariff trade barriers, and in particular the removal of unfair trading barriers against developing countries."
"856","6.Britain's Democracy: Electoral and Constitutional Reform. Liberal Democrats, alone in British politics, recognise that unless we change Britain's system of government, we cannot change Britain's future."
"857","Without constitutional reform, we will not achieve our other objectives."
"858","We believe in citizenship, not subjecthood - in the ability of all individuals to exercise power over the institutions that govern their lives."
"859","The creation of a modernised democracy therefore lies at the heart of our proposals."
"860","We recognise too that Britain's success in the next century will depend not just on changing what we do, but in changing the way in which we do it."
"861","However worthy its intentions, and however able its personnel, no government will be able to put Britain right unless and until it has modernised our constitution."
"863","Fair Voting for an Effective Parliament. Our current 'winner takes all' system of voting has many faults."
"864","It is unfair, unstable and divisive."
"865","Government by minority is usually bad government: in no truly democratic country could a disaster like the poll tax have been pushed through in defiance of public opinion, wasting billions of pounds and causing misery to millions of people."
"866","Our top priority is therefore the introduction of fair votes for all electinos at all levels of government."
"867","Fair votes will make every elector's vote count."
"868","It will increase citizens' control over their elected representatives, by abolishing safe seats."
"869","It will eradicate the power of the extremist minority in political parties."
"870","It will lead to a better choice of candidates and ensure that more women and candidates from minority ethnic communities are elected."
"871","Above all, it will reduce tit-for-tat politics and introduce much greater stability into government, allowing individuals and businesses alike to plan for their future with confidence."
"872","We will: Bring in fair votes."
"873","We will introduce proportional representation for all elections at local, national and European levels."
"874","We propose the single transferable vote, by which electors cast their votes in multi-member constituencies based on natural communities."
