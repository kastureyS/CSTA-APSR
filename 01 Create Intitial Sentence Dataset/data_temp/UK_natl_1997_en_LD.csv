"379","We will overhaul the Crown Prosecution Service."
"380","We will encourage the use of community sentences, as an alternative to prison, where the result is likely to be less reoffending, and use prison sentences where they are essential to public protection or to make punishment effective."

"398","The challenge for the next fifty years is to protect and enhance the richness of rural life, while developing a thriving rural economy."
"399","We will: Seek further reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)."
"400","We will work to replace the CAP, which currently subsidises production, with Countryside Management Contracts - a targeted system of direct payments to support economic, social and environmental goals in rural communities."

"432","Urban communities . Britain's towns and cities offer civic pride, accessible facilities and, potentially, a high quality of life."

"450","They can be engines of innovation that bring life to the economy."
"451","At the same time, the world is experiencing an information revolution as important and far-reaching as the Industrial Revolution."
"452","Britain must maintain a free and effective media capable of being a check on the abuse of power, and of giving people the information they need to make informed decisions."
"453","We will: Tackle the concentration of media power."

"470","The problem: The NHS has been squeezed between rising demand and government underfunding, and disrupted by repeated changes in government policy."

"478","Cut hospital waiting lists to a maximum of 6 months over 3 years."
"479","End the two-tier system in the NHS."
"480","Restore free eye and dental checks."
"482","Raising standards in the NHS. Whilst many of the recent reforms to the NHS have been beneficial, they have resulted in the creation of a two-tier health service."
"483","The standard of health care a person receives is increasingly becoming a lottery."

"501","We will: Invest more in the NHS."
"502","We will invest at least an extra £540 million every year in the NHS to pay for our policy priorities."
"503","This will be paid for by closing the loophole that allows employers to avoid paying National Insurance contributions on certain benefits in kind and by putting 5p on the price of a packet of 20 cigarettes."
"504","We will use these extra funds to tackle the crisis in staffing, especially in the hospital sector, and begin a shift to preventive care."
"505","We will ensure that the NHS budget keeps pace with increasing cost pressures."

"517","Tackle the crisis in NHS dental care."
"518","We will require local authorities to ensure that the public has access to NHS dentistry in all areas."
"520","Promoting good health. Britain has a health service that concentrates too much on curing illness rather than preventing it."
"521","A healthier nation and a more cost-effective NHS depend on shifting the emphasis towards prevention, tackling the root causes of ill health (e.g.poverty and homelessness) and making people more responsible for their own health."
"522","We will: Make prevention a priority."
"523","We will immediately abolish charges for eye and dental check-ups and freeze prescription charges as the first steps in a radical shift of policy that emphasises the prevention of illness rather than treatment."
"524","Encourage people to take more responsibility for their own health."
"525","We will improve health education and promote healthy living."

"557","Care for carers."
"558","We will introduce a new Carer's Benefit, in place of the Independent Living Allowance, in order to meet more of the financial cost of caring."
"559","We will extend the Carer's Benefit, as resources allow, to those over retirement age and work to improve advice, information, training and counselling for carers."
"560","We will seek to increase access to respite care and ensure that carers and users are involved in decisions about care."
"561","We will draw up a Charter that sets out carers' rights and responsibilities."
"562","Establish high national standards for all community care services."
"563","Our new independent Inspectorate of Health and Social Care will publish codes of practice for residential and nursing homes, and have the power to close any home that consistently falls short of national standards."

"571","Their politicians have lied to them, their Parliament has become tainted by sleaze and their government is out of touch and doesn't listen."
"572","Our commitment: Liberal Democrats will modernise Britain's outdated institutions, rebuild trust, renew democracy and give Britain's nations, regions and local communities a greater say over their affairs."
"573","Our priorities are to: Restore trust between people and government, by ending secrecy and guaranteeing peoples' rights and freedoms."

"635","Meanwhile, the welfare system no longer meets the needs of a modern society."
"636","It locks too many into dependency and, too often, penalises those who wish to work and save."
"637","Our commitment: Liberal Democrats will promote individual self-reliance, strengthen equality for all before the law and in employment, and work for a society that cherishes diversity."
