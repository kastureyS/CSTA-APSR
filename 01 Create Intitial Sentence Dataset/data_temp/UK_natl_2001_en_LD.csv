"221","In the long term, our goal is:  A maximum average class size of 18 for all secondary classes with a practical element such as science and modern languages.  "

"239","This would result in an annual cull of all irrelevant instructions to LEAs, schools and governing bodies."
"240","Issue annual reports to all parents on their children' school's performance."

"244","Reduce testing of the youngest school children."
"245","We will scrap testing ('SATs') at age 7, while keeping it for older pupils."
"246","Reform the school inspection system."
"247","Tough, independent inspection is essential, but the current approach of Ofsted often intimidates schools instead of helping them."
"248","We will require inspectors to offer advice on improvement, not merely criticism, and require Ofsted to take account of a school's self-evaluation."

"266","Strengthen links between home and school recognising that children's early development depends critically on the relationship between school and family."
"267","Ensure that the early years curriculum has sufficient quality and breadth to facilitate intellectual, emotional and social development and ensure that play is recognised as a key component of this process."

"270","During the eighteen years of Conservative rule, that reputation was threatened by an ever tighter squeeze on resources."

"291","We will provide the funding to allow any adult the chance to acquire a Level 2 qualification (the equivalent of 5 GCSEs at grades A to C, an intermediate GNVQ or a Foundation Modern Apprenticeship)."

"293","In the long term, our goal is to extend this further entitlement to every adult."
"294","All those on these courses would be entitled to a student loan to cover maintenance, depending on their income."
"295","Simplify the funding and qualification systems."

"297","We will also reform the National Vocational Qualification system to cut bureaucracy and allow students to accumulate credits from different courses and transfer them."
"298","In the long term, our goal is to:  Give every citizen an Individual Learning Account."
"299","Ultimately this approach to life-long learning would provide the flexibility to access each person' entitlement to post-sixteen education throughout a person' life, rather than at times imposed by the state."

"335","Greener School Buildings. We will fund a 'Schools 2010' programme to tackle the backlog of school building repairs."
"336","The programme would include environmental assessment of buildings and would promote the use of better insulation, double-glazing and solar panels where possible."
"337","We will work in partnership with the Further and Higher Education sectors to develop a similar scheme that covers all educational establishments."
"340","Law and Order. Cutting crime: more resources, justice for all.  We all want freedom from crime."
"341","Fear of crime blights the lives of many people, particularly the most vulnerable in society."
"342","The state should offer all its citizens equal and adequate protection."
"343","Our approach is rooted in the belief that the best way to beat crime in the medium and long term is to have effective policies to tackle its causes."
"344","Liberal Democrats will:  Recruit 6000 extra police officers."
"345","Fund 2000 part-time community officers."
"346","Reinforce front-line police with a new Community Safety Constabulary and by retaining retired officers in a back-up role."
"347","Cut reoffending by preparing prisoners adequately for a law-abiding life on their release."
"348","Give victims greater rights to be heard in court.  "
"349","During their eighteen years in office, the Conservatives pursued a policy on crime which was superficially populist yet highly ineffective."
"350","They filled the prisons to overflowing, at a huge cost to the taxpayer."
"351","Crime doubled, violent rose crime year after year, and the number of convictions fell."
"352","Meanwhile, contrary to repeated promises, police numbers fell during the last Conservative government."
"353","Labour has been trying to sound as tough or tougher than the Conservatives, but it is no more effective."
"354","Police numbers have fallen further over the past four years."
"355","Labour too often proposes simplistic solutions."
"356","Many are impractical or irrelevant."
"357","Some actually undermine civil liberties."
"359","Police. Our priority is to increase police numbers to prevent crime, to catch criminals when offences do take place, and to increase the current deplorably low clear-up rate."
"360","To make policing across the country more effective, we will:  Fund the police for 6000 more police officers than March 2000 levels."
"361","We will fund 2000 recruits on top of the government' plans to ensure there is real increase in police strength, not just replacing cuts under Labour and the Conservatives."
"362","We will also ensure that the police spend more time on front-line policing and provide extra resources to boost retention of police officers."
"363","Fund 2000 part-time community officers by creating a new category of part time retained police officers."
"364","This would give the police more flexibility."
"365","Suitable members of the public and police officers near retirement wishing to continue in work will be recruited, given proper training and equipped for the duties of a police constable."
"366","The scheme will build on the current role of unpaid special constables, and free existing police to use their time and resources more effectively."
"367","Retained officers will supplement the work of regular police and provide a more adequate presence in areas where resources have not permitted."
"368","This scheme will help to meet our aim of creating a network of named local police officers for every community."
"369","Establish a Community Safety Force to work with the police by co-ordinating the public safety work of traffic wardens, estate and neighbourhood wardens, park superintendents and other public officials who deal with nuisance crimes like littering, vandalism and graffiti."
"370","They will receive special training."
"371","This will free the police to concentrate on more serious offences."
"372","Make local Crime and Disorder Partnerships focus on real improvements for local residents."
"373","We will give local crime partnerships the responsibility for managing and directing Community Safety Forces."
"374","We will also fund the involvement of local police forces in community activities designed to involve ethnic minorities and increase public confidence in all sections of society."
"375","Make the police more accountable."
"376","Public confidence in the police has declined."
"377","As well as seeking to improve the visibility of the police and improving police relations with the community, we will create a genuinely independent police complaints system to deal with complaints speedily, efficiently and impartially."
"378","We will encourage police forces to be more representative of the communities they serve, and ensure that 'top and search' is based on intelligence and attaches no relevance to the race or colour of those stopped by the police."
"379","Commission an independent report on the police resources the country needs in the long term."
"380","We will establish a Standing Conference on Policing comprising representatives of all police ranks, the public and experts in policing issues."
"381","This will regularly report to government and parliament, advising on the resources required to provide an effective police presence in every community, and the management of police stations and technology."
"382","It will also review the use of police time, in particular that devoted to paperwork and court procedures."
"383","Support the work of Europol, the EU police agency, and the establishment of a European police college, subject to proper democratic oversight."
"384","We wish to see police forces working together in the fight against crime, particularly international crimes such as drug trafficking, terrorism, customs fraud, money laundering and the trade in human beings for slave labour or sexual exploitation."
"386","Prisons. The last Conservative Home Secretary Michael Howard famously said prison works."
"387","But half of the people who have served time in Britain's jails go on to reoffend on release."
"388","Many prisons are colleges of crime."
"389","People incarcerated for minor offences learn how to commit much more serious ones."
"390","Liberal Democrats reject the knee-jerk Conservative approach and Labour's attempts to echo it."
"391","We will not be any less tough on crime, but we will be more effective."
"392","We will:  Focus resources on crime prevention rather than prison building."
"393","Prisons are very expensive."
"394","There are many more cost-effective ways of reducing crime than ever-longer sentences."
"395","We believe that people should be sent to prison if the public need to be protected from them or if this is the only way to punish them effectively."
"396","But to release resources for crime prevention and to cut reoffending, we believe there is more scope for the use of community sentences which are proven to work, such as electronic tagging, reparation to victims, fines, drug treatment, and probation orders."
"397","Cut reoffending by ex-prisoners."
"398","Previous governments have concentrated a great deal on sending people to prison, but not nearly enough on what goes on once they are there."
"399","We believe that prisoners should put in a full working day in jail."
"400","They should also have access to skill training and courses in literacy to equip them for work after release, and be given more support and rehabilitation once they have completed their sentences."
"401","We will also use weekend and evening custody to permit some offenders during sentence to enter paid work prior to release."
"402","Make prisons more effective."
"403","We will make minimum levels of education and work, and rehabilitation programmes, central to prison regimes, and set standards expected through Service Delivery Agreements."
"404","We will increase the amount of commercial activity undertaken by prison industries."
"405","We will also boost the powers of the prison inspectorate so that it can force change, not just report on failure."
"406","In the long term, our goal is to:  Improve the successful resettlement of released prisoners."
"407","There should be more use of pre-release assessments of the resettlement needs of prisoners, in particular for the majority who have served sentences, and for whom current arrangements are totally inadequate."
"408","The focus of resettlement should be on housing needs, employment and training schemes, and preventing substance misuse."
"410","The Criminal Justice System. Conservative and Labour Governments in turn have attempted to erode the criminal justice system."
"411","Labour have been intent on curtailing the right to the fundamental freedom of jury trial, as first proposed by the Conservatives."
"412","The Conservatives increased the use of mandatory sentences, taking away judicial discretion to make decisions based appropriately on the facts of an individual case."
"413","Liberal Democrats wish to enhance the powers of the courts."
"414","We also want to see a greater recognition of the rights of victims of crime."
"415","We will:  Give victims or their families greater rights to be heard in court."
"416","We will give victims the right to be kept fully informed about the progress of the cases with which they are involved."
"417","We will also provide opportunities for them to make statements in court about the effect that the crime has had on them after the jury has delivered its verdict and before the judge passes sentence."
"418","We will offer victims greater support during the progress of a case."
"419","Criminal injury compensation is often inadequate or unavailable and so we will improve the scheme to ensure that the most serious cases receive adequate compensation."
"420","We will strengthen support for victims of domestic violence by offering more training in this area to the relevant professionals."
"421","Tackle hate crimes."
"422","We will establish police hate crime investigation units to coordinate information and action against racist, homophobic and other hate crimes."
"423","We will also legislate against hate crimes by widening current legislation to include all hate crimes on the same basis as that existing for racially motivated crime."
"424","End mandatory sentencing except for minor offences (such as fixed penalty motoring offences), so that judges and not politicians set sentences."
"425","Retain jury trials for middle-ranking cases threatened by the Mode of Trial Bill and restore the right to silence."
"426","Ensure that fostering and adoption law and practice are based on the suitability of individual fosterers and the needs of the child."
"427","In the long term, we will also:  Propose a new way of sentencing for the most serious offenders."
"428","We will consult on introducing indefinite sentences for the most serious sex and violent offenders, so that they would only be released following an assessment by the court of the risk which they pose to society."
"429","Create a Department of Justice."
"430","This will ensure a separation of powers between the legal system and law enforcement agencies, reform the powers of the Lord Chancellor, and help to provide a fairer system of justice for all."
"431","We will establish a review of the legal aid system, to ensure genuine access to justice."
"432","Overhaul the youth justice system."
"433","We will expand reform of the youth justice system to ensure a greater focus on the root causes of misbehaviour, and on education and rehabilitation."
"434","We want a greater role for the principles of restorative justice, with offenders meeting their victims, discovering the consequences of their actions and planning to improve their behaviour in the future."
"435","Reform would respond not only to the problems caused by child offenders but also to the problems they face."
"436","We also favour smaller youth custody units rather than large Young Offender Institutions and would ensure that those young people who must be held are sent to specialised units."
"438","Tackling the Causes of Crime. We recognise that many of the most effective measures against crime are not the responsibility of the police, the prison system or the courts."
"439","Our policies in many other areas will have a significant impact on the causes of crime."
"440","We will:  Invest in education to offer young people more opportunities."
"441","Encourage young people into constructive activity by increasing support for sport, recreation and the youth service."
"442","Encourage the use of Acceptable Behaviour Contracts (ABCs)."
"443","These will help reduce anti-social behaviour in communities by young people, without resorting to blanket curfews or immediate use of heavy-handed court action through Anti-Social Behaviour Orders."
"444","Expand facilities to help drug and alcohol abusers."
"445","We will prioritise funds to aim for a maximum four-week waiting time after an abuser is referred for treatment."
"446","Replace the New Deal with a Flexible Guarantee of help for all jobseekers, administered through a combined Benefits and Jobs Agency."
"447","Help ensure that care leavers do not drift into crime by offering them support with housing, education and training."
"448","Establish a National Crime Reduction Agency to oversee and advise on the work of local Crime Reduction Partnerships and other crime reduction work undertaken by central government."
"449","This will ensure that those partnerships are effective at finding local solutions to local crime problems."
"450","Establish a Standing Royal Commission to tackle the range of problems currently associated with drugs."
"451","The approach of successive governments has demonstrably failed."
"452","An independent Royal Commission will take a fresh look at the issue of illegal drugs and ways to tackle problems in such areas as health and the huge profits of organised crime."
"453","The Commission will also be charged with recommending strategies to address misuse of legal drugs such as alcohol and tobacco, and other legal substances such as solvents."
"455","Setting You Free. Liberalise licensing laws."
"456","We will replace mandatory closing times for pubs with locally determined opening times."
"457","Make non-payment of TV Licences a civil matter rather than a criminal offence."
"458","Abandon plans to introduce a Public Defender Scheme which would limit the independence of defence advocates."
"461","Green Action. Preventing Pollution.  We will improve enforcement of pollution controls through an expanded inspectorate for the Environment Agency, to support full implementation of the statutory pollution control regime."
"462","This will be reinforced by increasing the level of penalties which polluters have to pay and the introduction of legislation on corporate environmental liability."
"463","We will also use these same powers to ensure that biotech companies are liable for any harm caused by GM crops and food."
"466","Transport. Reliable and safe transport. A decent transport system is fundamental to an equitable and environmentally sustainable society."
"467","We will work to build an integrated transport system throughout the country that is safe, reliable and affordable."
"468","Our policies place special emphasis on reducing problems from pollution and congestion."
"469","Liberal Democrats will:  Provide free off-peak local travel on buses for pensioners and disabled people, and aim for half-price travel at all times for under-19s in full time education."
"470","Abolish car tax for those who drive less-polluting vehicles."
"471","Establish stronger public control over the railways.  "
"472","While progress in other public services in Britain has been disappointingly slow over the past four years, in transport the country has clearly gone backwards."
"473","Roads are more congested."
"474","Buses are less reliable."
"475","Railways are in chaos."
"476","Privatisation of the railways by the Conservatives has been a disaster."
"477","Regulation is too lax."
"478","Companies do not have the right incentives for long-term investment."
"479","The system is fragmented."
"480","It is all too easy, when things go wrong, for one firm to pass the buck to another."
"481","Safety can be compromised."
"482","Labour has failed to win the case for increased investment in public transport."
"483","When the price of petrol went up and revenues from petrol tax consequently soared, the Labour Government should have earmarked the extra revenue specifically for improving public transport."
"484","It failed to do so."
"486","Reducing Congestion and Pollution. Many people rely on their car."
"487","But it is in everyone' interests to reduce pollution to protect the environment and to provide a viable alternative to the car wherever possible."
"488","We will:  Reward motorists who drive less-polluting vehicles by reducing car tax (Vehicle Excise Duty) on more environmentally friendly cars and motorcycles - abolishing it altogether for the greenest vehicles."
"489","We will fund this by increasing the amount of VED charged on the most polluting vehicles."
"490","Guarantee not to increase the tax per litre of fuel taken by the government, in real terms, in the next Parliament."
"491","Should the government receive extra revenue from VAT due to increases in fuel prices, we will use it to ease burdens on the travelling public."
"492","Our policies for improving public transport and encouraging less polluting vehicles means that we do not need to increase petrol taxes further in order to meet our environmental objectives."
"493","Introduce environmental incentives for bus operators."
"494","We will reform fuel duty rebates for bus operators so that these are tied more closely to those running more efficient vehicles, particularly those using alternative fuels."
"495","Reduce road traffic."
"496","As part of our policies for reducing pollution and congestion we will introduce legislation to ensure that there are stronger targets for local authorities to reduce road traffic."
"497","We will also enable local authorities to raise bonds and establish congestion charging and private non-residential parking taxes to promote use of public transport."
"498","Reduce freight on the roads through increased use of railways and waterways."
"499","We will explore partnership options for developing Britain's waterways (which are vastly under-utilised at present)."
"500","We also plan to double the amount of freight carried on Britain' railways by 2010."
"502","Improving Public Transport. Britain' public transport system could be the envy of the world."
"503","At the moment, however, it is expensive, out of date and decaying."
"504","We will:  Extend free off-peak local travel on buses to pensioners and people with disabilities."
"505","This would extend across the UK the scheme currently operating in London and those being developed in Wales."
"506","In addition we aim to introduce a scheme of half-fares at all times for under 19s in full-time education."
"507","Increase investment in public transport."
"508","We will enable local authorities to raise bonds and establish congestion charging and private non-residential parking taxes (including out-of-town retail and workplace parking) to fund improved public transport."
"509","Priorities for investment include: reopening disused railway lines and stations "
"510","developing bus routes, cycle paths, trams, light rail systems, and walkways "
"511","better information for passengers through a National Public Transport Information System Local Authority "
"512","sponsored car-pooling schemes "
"513","and improving the ease with which passengers are able to transfer between different modes of transport."
"514","Create a Rural Transport Regeneration Fund to improve community transport schemes and public transport in rural areas."
"515","Support community transport, particularly in rural areas, including dial-a-ride, taxi buses, post buses and school buses, by widening eligibility for the existing fuel duty rebate tied into the emission standards of the vehicle."
"516","This will be funded in part by reducing eligibility for fuel duty rebate for commercial tour buses."
"518","Improving Transport Regulation and Performance. Much of the public transport system is run by private companies."
"519","This provides valuable competition, investment and innovation in the sector."
"520","But if it is to deliver everything that passengers deserve, it must be properly regulated."
"521","We will:  Reform the regulatory system for public transport."
"522","We will establish a Sustainable Transport Authority (STA) which will take over the functions of the Strategic Rail Authority and the existing Rail Regulator and also have responsibility for oversight of bus and coach operators, trams, ferries, coastal shipping and inland waterways."
"523","The STA will work to: upgrade safety, access and quality "
"524","enhance the rail network "
"525","tackle monopolies, particularly taking immediate and effective action against predatory behaviour in the bus industry "
"526","develop through-ticketing and timetable integration "
"527","improve the safety and quality of rail and bus stations by introducing a Safer Stations Charter Mark scheme "
"528","and ensure refunds for failure to fulfil adequate standards of service, including punctuality."
"530","Railways and the London Underground. Britain's railways are in chaos."
"531","They are a major casualty of many years of neglect and underinvestment by successive governments."
"532","We will work to see Railtrack become a not-for-profit, public interest company, and develop the railway system as the backbone of a modern transport system."
"533","In addition, we will:  Secure increased public control over public investment in the railways by ensuring the Sustainable Transport Authority (STA) takes responsibility for the allocation of public funds intended for new developments (as distinct from repair and renewal)."
"534","As part of this we will prioritise modernisation and development of the East and West Coast mainlines, and a new high-speed East Coast mainline between Aberdeen, London and the new Channel Tunnel Rail Link."
"535","Seek to restructure Railtrack."
"536","We will ask the Competition Commission to review Railtrack' activities under a public interest reference so that a suitable restructuring can be imposed on the company."
"537","We believe that any changes must simplify the structure of our railway system by using the STA to reduce the number of franchises, and by encouraging Railtrack to pass responsibility for track renewal and repair to the major train operating companies."
"538","Simplify regulation."
"539","We will bring together the role of the Rail Regulator and SRA within the STA."
"540","We will also seek to alter the current bureaucratic penalty system into a simpler scheme of incentives."
"541","In addition, the range of fares that can only be altered with agreement from the fares regulator (at present the SRA) will be widened."
"542","We will create a new independent body within the STA with responsibility for timetabling."
"543","Improve railway safety."
"544","We will implement the recommendations made by Lord Cullen' inquiry into Railway Safety."
"545","We will create a new Railway Safety body within the STA to take regulation of railway safety."
"546","We will also create an accident investigation body modelled on the Air Accident Investigation Branch."
"547","Modernise the London Underground."
"548","We believe that the best way to modernise the Underground, without compromising safety, is through a not-for-profit, public interest company funded through bonds."
"550","Roads. For many people, roads are the backbone of the country' transport."
"551","But there has been too much focus on building new ones and not enough attention paid to the roads that already exist."
"552","We will:  Boost the repair and maintenance of roads."
"553","We are committed to improving the quality of the existing network, with the safety benefits that this would bring."
"554","We will undertake road widening and by-pass schemes only where there are clear safety benefits and where, on balance, there is an environmental benefit."
"555","Establish fair competition for British freight companies."
"556","We will cut significantly freight vehicle excise duty, funding this by introducing a daily charge which includes overseas hauliers who currently escape VED."
"557","Improve road safety."
"558","We will work towards a target of at least a 40% reduction in those killed and seriously injured on the roads by 2010."
"559","We will implement a National Programme of Home Zones for residential areas, and Quiet Lanes in rural areas."
"560","This will reduce vehicle speeds and make communities safer by giving greater priority to pedestrians and cyclists."
"561","We will also strengthen the enforcement of weights and safety standards on the road haulage industry."
"563","Aviation. Travel by air is growing, raising environmental and safety issues."
"564","We will:  Reject privatisation of National Air Traffic Services creating instead a not-for-profit, public body to protect safety in the air."
"565","Work to reform aviation fuel taxation."
"566","We will work at the European level to ensure that the whole system of aviation fuel taxation is reformed internationally, as part of a longer-term strategy for reducing energy use and pollution through cleaner fuels and more efficient aircraft."
"567","We will also press the EU Commission to allow removal of remaining air passenger duty on flights to peripheral and less accessible parts of the UK which rely on air transport."
"568","Restrict noisy night flights and airport expansion."
"569","We will ensure that restrictions are imposed on the expansion of night flights where these will have a negative impact upon residential areas."
"570","In addition, we will ensure that there are clear rules governing future expansion of airports, strengthening consideration of environmental impacts and safety implications."
"572","Setting You Free. Cut restrictions on local government which prevent councils from raising funds to improve public transport and the environment."
"575","Green Action. Planning for Public Transport. Our policies are designed to reduce the need to travel through better use of the planning system, and investment in improving public transport so that people are no longer forced to use their car unnecessarily."
"576","We will introduce Regional Transport Plans and strengthen Local Transport Plans to set effective strategies for reducing congestion, pollution and traffic growth."
"578","Less Road Building. We will reverse plans for new road building in environmentally sensitive areas."
"580","Cleaner and More Efficient Vehicles. We will promote technologies which improve vehicle efficiency and the use of alternative fuel systems such as Liquefied Petroleum Gas, and, in the longer term, biofuels and zero emission vehicles."
"581","In addition, we will improve testing of vehicle emissions and strictly enforce freight vehicle weight limits and other safety standards by increasing resources devoted to roadside testing as well as strengthening the MOT test."
"582","We will oppose further increases in weight limits for freight vehicles."
"585","Pensions, Wages and Benefits. Freedom from poverty. Poverty restricts freedom because people without a decent income do not have the opportunities enjoyed by others."
"586","More needs to be done for pensioners and those with low incomes to ensure that all in Britain have a better quality of life."
"587","Liberal Democrats will:  Boost the basic state pension, particularly for the over-75s."
"588","Support disabled people by extending winter fuel allowance payments to the severely disabled."
"589","Help the lower paid by aiming to reduce taxation for poorer taxpayers."
"590","Protect workers on low incomes by reviewing the minimum wage annually."
"591","Tackle child poverty with extra money for families on long-term income support.  "
"592","It is a great indictment of the Governments of Margaret Thatcher, John Major and Tony Blair that all of them allowed the gap between rich and poor people in Britain to become wider than before."
"593","The Blair Government has taken a disappointingly mean-spirited approach towards pensioners and lone parents in particular."
"594","We recognise that there are many theatres in the war against poverty."
"595","Our success in tackling poverty in Britain would be measured by a Quality of Life Index."
"596","This would include a statement of the standards which a citizen of the UK might reasonably expect to enjoy in order to participate fully in society and have a decent quality of life."
"598","Pensions. Britain's pensioners have not forgotten the miserliness of the 75p increase they were allowed last year."
"599","Under first the Conservatives and now Labour, the real value of state pensions has fallen further and further."
"600","Elderly people require both an immediate substantial boost to their incomes and a guarantee that their interests will always be considered not just in the run-up to General Elections."
"601","Under Labour, there has been a big increase in means-testing for pensioners."
"602","Many elderly people are too proud to claim money which is due to them."
"603","It is quite possible to target the poorest people in society without resorting to means tests."
"604","Liberal Democrats will:  Increase the basic state pension by £5 a week for each single pensioner, £10 for the over-75s and £15 for the over-80s."
"605","Couples will receive £8, £18 and £28 respectively."
"606","We will give the most to older pensioners because they are amongst the poorest and neediest people in the country."
"607","For the past thirty years, they have received a derisory 25p a week at 80 over and above the basic pension."
"608","We will also reward pensioners who have saved throughout their lives by scrapping the rules which deny help to people with savings above £12,000."
"609","Fund our big increases in pensions by setting a new top tax rate of 50p on income over £100,000 a year."
"610","To put this measure into perspective, for most of the Thatcher years, the top rate was 60p starting on substantially lower incomes."
"611","Establish an Independent Pensions Authority."
"612","To guarantee that pensioners do not fall behind the rest of the population, the Authority will report annually to the Government on an appropriate uprating for the state pension."
"613","It will take into account levels of pensioner poverty, the growth in earnings and national income and affordability."
"614","We will also establish a more stable environment for pension planning by seeking to secure all-party consensus before making future pension reforms."
"615","Strengthen the position of people with private pensions by ensuring that members of company pension schemes, including retired members, have a greater say over the use of their pension fund."
"616","We will also relax current rules which require people with personal pensions to buy an annuity on or before their 75th birthday."
"617","In the long term, our goal is to:  Introduce a new Owned Second Pension Account."
"618","We believe that the best way to prevent poverty among future generations is to ensure that all people have a second pension of their own to top up the state pension."
"619","Over time we would ensure that a growing proportion of the workforce were members either of a company pension scheme or had an Owned Second Pension Account, with the government making contributions for those who because of ill health, unemployment or caring responsibilities are too poor to do so."
"620","Extend the entitlement to the basic state pension to all citizens."
"621","People would no longer have to show a history of contributions in order to claim their basic pension."
"622","This would eventually help around 3.4 million people, mainly women, carers and long-term disabled people."
"624","Low Pay and Benefits. There is a great deal of talk about scroungers on the welfare state."
"625","Liberal Democrats will be vigilant against those who seek to cheat the system."
"626","Equally, there are many people in Britain who are in need who have to depend on the state."
"627","Among them are low-paid workers with families, lone parents and children."
"628","We will:  Protect workers on low incomes by reviewing the national minimum wage annually on the basis of recommendations from the Low Pay Commission."
"629","The minimum wage has proved an effective way of protecting workers on low incomes, without causing damage to business."
"630","We believe it is wrong to set a lower rate minimum wage for workers under 21."
"631","We will set the same rate for all people aged 16 and over."
"632","Alleviate child poverty by paying an additional £200 per year to all families with children who have been on income support for more than a year."
"633","Such children suffer from the poverty their parents find themselves in."
"634","We will also abolish the Child Support Agency, which has caused unjustifiable hardship to so many people, and replace it with a system of family courts."
"635","Their maintenance assessments will be strongly enforced and will supplant the rough justice of the current crude and simplistic formula."
"636","Support young people and reduce homelessness by restoring 16 and 17 year-olds' entitlements to benefits and by increasing housing benefit for the under-25s by ending the Single Room Rent Restriction which effectively requires them to share accommodation."
"637","Provide more support for disabled people."
"638","We will support severely disabled people by bringing them within the scope of the Winter Fuel Payment system."
"639","We also believe that the benefits system should recognise what disabled people can do rather than requiring them to prove what they cannot."
"640","In particular, we will investigate the feasibility of introducing a Partial Capacity Benefit for those able to do some work."
"641","Simplify Housing Benefit administration and reduce the scope for benefit fraud by requiring all local authorities to adopt effective anti-fraud strategies."
"642","End discrimination in gas, water and electricity charges encouraging the regulator to offer a wider tariff choice which helps the poorest people in society."
"643","At the moment, for instance, households which use pre-payment meters end up paying higher rates than other users."
"644","We will also seek to have standing charges replaced with a banded system of charging to protect poor households and encourage high users to conserve energy. "
"645","Make cold weather payments to people receiving income support more effective by ensuring that they take account of 'wind chill' which is currently overlooked."
"646","We will also seek to take proper account of local weather conditions."
"647","In the long term, our goal is to:  Remove taxation for the lowest paid."
"648","We believe that people start paying tax at too low a level and will work to reduce the burden of taxation on the low paid."

"671","Promote diversity in culture, the arts and sport.  "

"675","We will:  Give all pupils an entitlement to arts education throughout their school careers."
"676","We will recruit and train more specialist art teachers and ensure that all primary teachers are well trained in the arts."

"689","Broadcasting. High-quality television and radio are essential components of a modern democracy and of a modern civilised society."
"690","But as media outlets multiply, the current system of regulation is increasingly ineffective."
"691","This is exacerbated by the complicated and often overlapping roles of many different regulators."
"692","We will:  Create a single Office of Communications (OFCOM) with the flexibility to regulate emerging communications technologies and ensure service provision across the country."
"693","Redefine public service broadcasting including breadth and quality of output, distinct regional output and free-to-air status."
"694","OFCOM would ensure that these standards are maintained into the future."

"726","Labour has over-regulated in some areas and under-regulated in others."
"727","Neither party has really backed new enterprise and new ideas."
"728","Small businesses have to deal with an avalanche of red tape, while the utility and railway companies have been allowed to get away with far too much."
"729","Liberal Democrats seek to encourage innovation and risk-taking, protect the rights of consumers and workers, and safeguard the environment."
"730","We also want to maintain the City of London' pre-eminence as an international financial centre."
"732","Business. Business people want to get on with running their companies, creating wealth and providing more opportunities for their staff."

"1143","Strengthening Europe's Voice on the Global Environment. We will argue for the EU to play a greater role in raising environmental standards world-wide, through providing support for the UN Environment Programme and for the enforcement of environmental conventions, such as those protecting endangered species, combating climate change, and controlling the trade in GM products."

"1157","Foreign Policy. Britain stands at the centre of a web of global institutions."
"1158","Our membership of the UN Security Council, the Commonwealth, the EU, NATO, and other global bodies gives Britain a key role in world affairs."
"1159","But with power comes responsibility."

"1269","Membership of the euro at a competitive and sustainable rate would offer Britain considerable benefits."

"1284","Send each household an annual Citizen's Tax Contract."
"1285","This would show in simple terms how much tax is being raised, what services are being delivered and why changes have been made."
